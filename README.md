HR Analytics and Predictive Modeling

Project Overview

I recently completed a project to analyze a dataset and build predictive models to provide actionable insights for the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm. The objective was to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company and use the insights to support HR strategies.

Key Deliverables

Stakeholder Summary: A concise, one-page summary presenting key insights, prepared as if I were the data professional at Salifort Motors.

Comprehensive Notebook: This notebook includes all stages of the project, from data cleaning to modeling and evaluation.

Approach

I independently implemented a machine learning model to predict employee attrition. This involved:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and relationships in the data through visualizations and statistical summaries.

Model Development: Building and tuning machine learning models to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualizations: Creating informative charts and graphs to directly address the project question.

Ethical Considerations: Reflecting on the ethical implications of data usage and model outcomes.

Additional Notes

Throughout the project, I documented the resources and methods used to troubleshoot and overcome challenges. This notebook serves as a complete record of the work and the insights gained. It is a resource for both technical review and practical application.
